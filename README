MENU:
There are 3 menu options: EXPRESSION, HISTORY, and EXIT. Typing an expression
(validity notwithstanding) will result in an attempt at calculation. Typing
HISTORY (case insensitive) will list the previous 10 expressions and their
results as equations. Typing EXIT (case insensitive) will end the program.

EXPRESSIONS:
A Texas Instruments TI-89 Titanium calculator was used as reference; i.e. a
valid expression on such a calculator will likely be considered a valid
expression within this program. For best results, it is recommended to type an
expression with no whitespace. Whitespace between numbers and numbers will
always be replaced with a single '*' as multiplication. Whitespace between
numbers and operators or between operators and operators will be discarded.

PRECEDENCE:
The following table demonstrates the levels of precedence Commacalc will
follow given a valid expression. If there is a tie between two or more
operators within a single expression, the leftmost operator(s) will be
evaluated first.

LEVEL   OPERATION        OPERATOR
1       PARENTHESIS      ()
2       EXPONENTIATION   ^
2       FACTORIAL        !
3       MULTIPLICATION   *
3       DIVISION         /
3       MODULO           %
4       ADDITION         +
4       SUBTRACTION      -
